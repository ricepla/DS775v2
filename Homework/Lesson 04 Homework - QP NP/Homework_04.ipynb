    "A stockbroker, Richard Smith, has just received a call from his most important client, Ann Hardy. Ann has $50,000 to invest and wants to use it to purchase two stocks. Stock 1 is a solid blue-chip security with a respectable growth potential and little risk involved. Stock 2 is much more speculative. It is being touted in two investment newsletters as having outstanding growth potential but also is considered very risky. Ann would like a large return on her investment but also has considerable aversion to risk. Therefore, she has instructed Richard to analyze what mix of investments in the two stocks would be appropriate for her.\n",

After doing some research, Richard has made the following estimates. The expected return per block is 5 for stock 1 and 10 for stock 2. The variance of the return on each block is 4 for stock 1 and 100 for stock 2. The covariance of the return on one block each of the two stocks is 5.

Because these products would share the same production facilities, the total number of units produced of the two products combined cannot exceed two per hour.

In particular, with a production rate of $R_1$ units per hour, it is estimated that Product 1 would provide a profit (in dollars per hour) of $200 R_1 - 100 R_1^2.$ If the production rate of product 2 is $R_2$ units per hour, its estimated profit (in dollars per hour) would be $300 R_2 - 100 R_2^2.$  \n",

However, each distribution center must receive exactly 20 trucks per week.\n",

Use Pyomo to solve this problem.  You may find code from earlier lessons to be helpful.  Note that the total supply is greater than the total demand so you'll to include a dummy distribution center that receives the excess supply to turn this into a balanced transportation problem.  (Review the setup in the textbook for product splitting - you should end up with four plants after splitting.)\n",

Make no assumptions about the quantity shipped from any plant.  Your code should still work if the cost table is changed.\n",

Each soldier that is manufactured increases Giapetto’s variable labor and overhead costs by \\$14 (so think about what the unit profit would be). A train sells for \\$21 and uses \\$9 worth of raw materials. Each train built increases Giapetto’s variable labor and overhead costs by \\$10. The manufacture of wooden soldiers and trains requires two types of skilled labor: carpentry and finishing. A soldier requires 2 hours of finishing labor and 1 hour of carpentry labor. A train requires 1 hour of finishing labor and 1 hour of carpentry labor. Each week, Giapetto can obtain all the needed raw material but only 80 carpentry hours and 100 finishing hours.

For instance, based on the second \"row\" we know that the constraint for the 8am - 10am time period is $$ 1 x_{s1} + 1 x_{s2} + 0 x_{s3} + 0 x_{s4} + 0 x_{s5} \\geq 79$$ because only agents in shifts 1 and 2 provide coverage for that time period."

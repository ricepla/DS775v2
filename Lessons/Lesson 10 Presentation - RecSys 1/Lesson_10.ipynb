    "# Simple Recommender\n",
    "Simple recommenders simply return a list of values that are sorted by some kind of score. The most complicated bit of a simple recommender is determining the appropriate score to use. There's no right answer for what the score is or how it should be calculated. You'll need to consider the data that you're working with and decide how to calculate a meaningful score. For example, if you're interested in highly-rated movies, you might need to consider both the average rating for a movie and the number of people that rated the movie. Say you have a rating scale from 1 to 5 stars. Your highest average rating would be 5 - a perfect score. But does a rating of 5 by one user mean the same thing as a rating of 5 by 100 users? Probably not.\n",

    "* v is the number of votes garnered by the movie\n",
    "* m is the minimum number of votes required for the movie to be in the chart (the prerequisite)\n",

    "* C is the mean rating of all the movies in the dataset\n",
    "\n",
    "Banik chose the 80th percentile for the minimum number of votes to be included in the recommender. \n",
    "\n",
    "Note that Banik chooses m (our minimum number of votes) based on the whole dataset, because IMDB sets this as the minimum threshold for being included in the ratings. So m is both a part of the metric AND a filter.\n",

    "Let's also base C on the whole dataset to start.\n",
    "\n",

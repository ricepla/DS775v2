Looking just at the hyperparameter optimization of the `xgbr_model` we found that `GridSearchCV` was the most expensive with 960 model fits, but found a very good model.  `RandomSearchCV` and `BayesianOptimizaion` both used 125 model fits and `BayesianOptimization` identified the model with the lowest MSE on the test data.  However, be careful before concluding that Bayesian Optimization outperforms Random Search.  If you change the random number seeds you'll get different results and Bayesian Optimization will not always be the winner.  However, the consensus is that it works better than Random Search on average.\n\nThe last thing we ran was an AutoML experiment with TPOT which used a genetic algorithm to search over many different models and hyperparameter choices.  The model it identified was a pretty crazy nested model that didn't perform as well as the optimized `xgboost` model, but it does provide a starting point for other directions to look.  \n\nIf you're curious to explore further, there are many AutoML tools being developed.

However, the model doesn't see the test data during model training.

Basically the training data is divided into k subsets and the subsets are used to build models.  The scores from these models are averaged to estimate the score when applied to unseen data.  Cross validation is used by all of our hyperparameter optimization algorithms to estimate the model score and this estimated score is what we try to optimize.  \n\nWe won't really have to do cross-validation directly, but this bit of code shows how we could do it using `sklearn`.

{"cell_type":"markdown","id":"1de6b4","input":"Fitting a model in machine learning is an optimization problem.  In a previous lesson we saw how logistic and linear regression use optimization to find the regression model coefficients to minimize difference between observed and predicted values of the response variable.  \n\nMost machine learning models also come with a bunch of parameters that need to be set which can alter the fit of the model.  For example here is the `LogisticRegression` class from scikit learn (`sklearn`):\n\n```\nclass sklearn.linear_model.LogisticRegression(penalty=’l2’, dual=False, tol=0.0001, C=1.0, fit_intercept=True, intercept_scaling=1, class_weight=None, random_state=None, solver=’warn’, max_iter=100, multi_class=’warn’, verbose=0, warm_start=False, n_jobs=None, l1_ratio=None)\n```\n\nSome of these parameters have to do with exactly what model is fit.  For instance, `penalty` changes the form of regularization added to the objective function to prevent overfitting while `C` changes the strength of the regularization (larger `C` is less regularization).  These extra parameters are usually called hyperparameters and to get the best model they often need to be tuned.  This tuning is another kind of optimization and is usually called \"hyperparameter optimization\" or \"hyperparameter tuning\".  This is a hot area and a little searching with Google will yield a ton of results.  <a href=\"https://medium.com/criteo-labs/hyper-parameter-optimization-algorithms-2fe447525903\">Here is one article</a> that gives an overview of hyperparameter tuning methods (but gets a bit technical at the end).\n\nTo keep everything straight it helps to remember that model parameters and hyperparameters are different.  Hyperparameters are set or determined before the model is fit.  Model parameters are determined during the process of fitting the model to the data.\n\nHere are four kinds of hyperparameter optimization we'll explore:\n\n* **Grid Search:**  choose a list of possible values for each hyperparameter and loop over all the combinations of hyperparameters while fitting a model for each combination.  Return the combination that gives the best model performance.  We'll use `GridSearchCV` from the `sklearn` package.  \n\n* **Random Search:** choose a list of possible values, or a probability distribution, for each hyperparameter.  Choose combinations at random and return the combination that gives the best model performance.  We'll use `RandomSearchCV` from the `sklearn` package.\n\n* **Bayesian Optimization:**  after each iteration an approximate model of the objective function, called a surrogate model, is built and used to suggest a better set of hyperparameters for the next iteration.  This is really useful for objective functions that are expensive to evaluate and for which there is uncertainty or noise in the function values as there always will be when we sample data at random to feed into a machine learning model.  We'll use `BayesianOptimization` from the `GPyOpt` package.  Other popular Python packages include `HyperOpt` and `Scikit-Optimize`.  We aren't going to study the details of Bayesian Optimization in this class, but there are a number of tutorials on the topic.  I think <a href=\"http://krasserm.github.io/2018/03/21/bayesian-optimization/\">this article</a> is an especially good place to start if you want to learn more about the details.  In particular, the section called \"Implementation with NumPy and SciPy\" walks through the process of maximize a simple $y = f(x)$.\n\n* **Genetic Algorithms:**  a population of possible hyperparameter sets is evolved using selection, crossover, and mutation with the goal of identifying hyperparameters that yield trained models with the best performance.  We'll use the TPOT package.  We'll also see that the TPOT package is really an auto machine learning package because it can pick between multiple models using the genetic algorithm.\n\nThere are **other hyperparameter optimization approaches**, but Bayesian Optimization is currently the most popular.  Work through this presentation to get an idea of how hyperparameter optimization works!\n\nIf you haven't taken DS740 - Data Mining and Machine Learning yet, you can still follow along and do the assignment, but you might wish to revisit this assignment after you've completed DS740.  We're going to walk through the four methods of hyperparameter optimization using a problem involving regression.

It especially excels when there are lots of hyperparameters, but it won't beat random search every time.  The power of Bayesian optimization is that it can often achieve good results with a relatively short number of training iterations.  \n\nThe setup is a bit more complicated.  We start by specifying the bounds as a list of dictionaries.  For each hyperparameter we give a name, the type, and the range.  If you want to use strings or non-equally space values then you have to work a bit harder, but we shouldn't need that for this project.\n\nThe function `cv_score()` receives a nested list with hyperparameter values that we use to setup the model.

Then we call TPOT and it returns an optimized model in an object that behaves just like objects returned by GridSearchCV and RandomSearchCV.  Additional models could be added as `'model_name':{'param':values,'param':value,...}`.\n\nWe've found that we generally need more model fits to get good results with TPOT than we did with Bayesian Optimization, but it still works really well.  Note that TPOT is maximizing the k-fold cross-validated negative mean square error instead of r-squared, but it gets us to the same place.  Here we iterate for 5 generations with 20 different individual sets of hyperameters in each generation.  For each individual we do 5 model fits (k = 5) and there is an extra round of cross validated fits for the initial population, thus altogether we perform $6 \\times 20 \\times 5 = 600$ model fits.","metadata":{"hidden":true},"pos":69,"type":"cell"}

Some of the hyperparameters don't directly change the model like `nthread` and `verbosity`.  Of the rest we'll pick a subset to optimize.  Some commonly optimized parameters are `n_estimators`, `max_depth`, `learning_rate`, `subsample`, and `min_child_weight` (these are the same ones that are optimized in the `TPOT` package). Two other hyperparameters linked to regularization terms are `reg_lambda` and `reg_alpha` which can be useful to prevent overfitting.\n\nThe table below lists some typical values and default values:\n\nHyperparameter | Default Value | Typical Range\n---- | ---- | ----\nn_estimators | 100 | 10 to 150\nmax_depth | 3 | 1 to 10\nmin_child_weight | 1 | 1 to 20\nlearning_rate | 0.1 | 0.001 to 1\nsubsample | 1 | 0.05 to 1\nreg_lambda | 1 | 0 to 5\nreg_alpha  | 0 | 0 to 5\n\nOf course, we could throw more hyperparameters into the mix, but we'll keep the numbers down to so we can afford to experiment.

For real problems this process could take days (see the <a href=\"https://epistasislab.github.io/tpot/using/#what-to-expect-from-automl-software\">TPOT discussion of AutoML</a>.

We'll do this by revisiting the scheduling problem from Lesson 7. But, we're going to make it a little more true-to-life by acknowledging some of the uncertainty in our estimates, and using simulation to help us come up with better estimates. We'll use our estimated profits to construct a payoff table and make a decision about how to proceed with the building project.\n\nThere is no additional presentation for Project 3 since all of the material you need was covered in Lessons 7, 8, and 9.","pos":0,"type":"cell"}

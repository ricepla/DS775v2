Management of Silicon Dynamics now is considering doing full-fledged market research at a cost of $1 million to predict which of the two levels of demand is likely to occur. Previous experience indicates that such market research is correct two-thirds of the time. Assume that the prior probabilities of the two levels of sales are both 0.5.\n\nProblem 16.2-2 says:\n\nSilicon Dynamics has developed a new computer chip that will enable it to begin producing and marketing a personal computer if it so desires. Alternatively, it can sell the rights to the computer chip for \\$15 million. If the company chooses to build computers, the profitability of the venture depends upon the company’s ability to market the computer during the first year. It has sufficient access to retail outlets that it can guarantee sales of 10,000 computers. On the other hand, if this computer catches on, the company can sell 100,000 computers. For analysis purposes, these two levels of sales are taken to be the two possible outcomes of marketing the computer, but it is unclear what their prior probabilities are. If the decision is to go ahead with producing and marketing the computer, the company will produce as many chips as it finds it will be able to sell, but not more. The cost of setting up the assembly line is \\$6 million. The difference between the selling price and the variable cost of each computer is \\$600.\n\n(a) Find EVPI for this problem.\n\n(b) Does the answer in part (a) indicate that it might be worthwhile to perform this market research?\n\n(c) Develop a probability tree diagram in Silver Decisions and use \"Flip subtree\" to obtain the posterior probabilities of the two levels of demand for each of the two possible outcomes of the market research.\n\n(e) Find EVE.

However, there is some uncertainty in the financial data (\\\\$15 million, \\\\$6 million, and $600) stated in Prob. 16.2.2. Each could vary from its base value by as much as 10 percent. For each one, perform sensitivity analysis to find what would happen if its value were at either end of this range of variability (without any change in the other two pieces of data) by adjusting the values in the data cells accordingly. Then do the same for the eight cases where all these pieces of data are at one end or the other of their ranges of variability.","pos":66,"type":"cell"}
